- Draft a phased wage correction plan.
- Notify impacted employees and communicate timelines.
- Perform quarterly wage reviews to ensure continued compliance.

**4. Review and Standardize Performance Rating Criteria**
-Investigate the rating framework and manager evaluation patterns to ensure consistency and reduce unconscious bias.
Train managers on inclusive performance management and unconscious bias mitigation.

**5. Strengthen Data Transparency and Reporting**
- Implement quarterly dashboards tracking gender representation, ratings, pay gaps, and minimum wage compliance.
- Include diversity and equity statistics in internal HR reports and annual public disclosures.

**6. Foster Career Growth for Women**
- Launch a mentorship and leadership development program for high-performing female staff, especially in departments with upward mobility barriers.
- Encourage balanced gender representation in promotion, training, and succession planning pipelines.

## Conclusion
The Palmoria Group must take swift and structured action to resolve the gender-related issues identified.

Strategic reform and transparent communication will be vital to reposition the company for growth and credibility both locally and globally.
